# LRDNet
This repository contains the official implementation of LRDNet. LRDNet is a lightweight and new method that efficiently detects free road space. The proposed network is lightweight having only 19.5 M parameters (approximately). To date, the LRDNet has the least parameters and the lowest processing time.


#In progress
Please wait, we will update the details on the proposed scheme and how to run the codes along with the pre-trained models very soon.
